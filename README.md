# Philosophers

This is project is about the usage of threads and mutexes.

## Description

There are `n` philosophers in a round table, each philosopher can take one of
three actions:

- Eat
- Sleep
- Think

There are `n` forks on the table, although a philosopher needs two forks to
eat, one from each side. After eating they go to sleep.

As soon as they wake up they start thinking, until they get hungry again.
